'''
1) Score lines per match
-   Objective: estimate the scoring rates of each team
-   Ingredients:
        o    Closing odds on the result averaged over bookmakers
        o    Closing odds on O/U-totals averaged over bookmakers
-   Procedure:
        o    Assuming independently Poisson distributed number of goals scored b H and A
        o    Predict the scoreline probabilities for each match (match-level)
        o    Sum all predicted scoreline probabilities to calculate the probabilities of potential match outcomes
        o    Estimate scoring rates by minimizing the squared difference between the bookmaker implied probabilities
             and the outcome probabilities from the in-play model
2) Score lines per minute
-    Objective: distributing scoring rates across the minutes
-    Ingredients: use scores dataset
-    Procedure:
        o    Assume the average amount of injury time to evenly share out the inflated scoring rates in the
             45th and 90th min across these extra minutes
        o    Presume all matches to be 93 min long
        o    Calculate a moving average over 15 min to smooth the relative frequency distributions
        o    Backward interpolate the missing values at the beginning of each series (first 15 min)
        o    calculate the density function of goals scored per minute
-   Problem:
        o    average scoring behavior might not adequately represent a teamâ€™s scoring pattern
        o    eventually use team-specific empirical goal distributions (though then we might have several zeros since not all teams score in all minutes)
3) Number of goals per minute
-   Simulate the number of goals in each minute using the score lines per minute
-   Sum up score line and record result, repeat 100,000 times per min => 9 Mio times per match
4) Calculate hypothetical probabilities
-   what are the probabilities for H-win, draw, A-win if either H or A do score in the next min
-   to calculate suspense
    - iterate through each minute
        - get the probabilities for H-win, draw and A-win given a home score (use simulation values added to current home score)
            - square the difference between these and the given probabilities for H-win, draw and A-win for the minute
            - multiply that squared differene by the probability of scoring in the next minute
            - sum all of these values
        - get the probabilities for H-win, draw and A-win given an away score (use simulation values added to current away score)
            - square the difference between these and the given probabilities for H-win, draw and A-win for the minute
            - multiply that squared differene by the probability of scoring in the next minute
            - sum all of these values
        - sum the sum of values
-   Account for red cards by modifying scoring rates
